- 👋 Hi, I’m @jordanheb9
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, web design, and how networks work.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of computer science and programming. I am finishing up the Harvard CS50x course.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that could use a friendly individual that is eager to learn and gain experience programming.
- 📫 How to reach me: jordanheb9@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I work in construction and have a PoliSci degree, but I built my PC during COVID and have been obsessed with computer science ever since.
